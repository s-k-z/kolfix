## Installation

To install, copy and paste the following into the KoLmafia Graphical CLI aka GCLI:

```
git checkout https://github.com/s-k-z/kolfix.git release
```

## Usage

**For a full list of options in KoLmafia**:

```
kolfix
```

**Examples**:

Set today's June Cleaver counters to safe values, for other scripts to continue automating with it (also resets on rollover/ascension):

```
kolfix cleaver
```

In the event of a power outage, Windows bluescreen, or other catastrophic failure during the automation of a KoLmafia script, this will disable all limited resources allowing you to resume automation (with potentially suboptimal results, but better than nothing):

```
kolfix disableAll
```

Check any properties that can be automatically updated, set permanent pool skill and manual of numberology to the maximum, and mark gingerbread city and tunnel of love as owned and fully upgraded:

```
kolfix auto maxAll
```

Set the quantity of manuals of numberology used to 3, and rack 'em up count to 10:

```
kolfix numberology=3 pool=10
```

To set the number of [glitch season reward name] implementations, either fight the %monster% today and record the big meat drop (same value as hp and mp restored) or search your most recent session log for this value. Calculate:

`X = today's %monster% meat drop / (5 x [glitch season reward names] owned)`

for example: `100 = 1000 meat / (5 x 2 [glitch season reward names])`

```
kolfix glitch=100
```
